## What is this project
This is a fork from [Wattpad2Epub](https://github.com/GatoLoko/Wattpad2Epub) that aims to implement a simple GUI so that the program becomes more accessible.

## TODO
- [x] Implement a GUI to download a single book
- [x] Make sure the program is still usable in CLI mode
- [ ] Add usable feedback to the GUI so that it will not fail silently
- [x] Add a way to download several ebooks at once
- [ ] Progress bar / notifications
